    <h3>Performed by Rihanna</h3>
    <p>
        Lift me up
        Hold me down
        Keep me close
        Safe and sound
        Burning in a hopeless dream
        Hold me when you go to sleep
        Keep me in the warmth of your love
        When you depart, keep me safe
        Safe and sound
        Lift me up
        Hold me down
        Keep me close
        Safe and sound
        Drowning in an endless sea
        Take some time and stay with me
        Keep me in the strength of your arms
        Keep me safe
        Safe and sound
        Lift me up
        Hold me down
        Keep me safe
        Safe and sound
        Burning in a hopeless dream
        Hold me when you go to sleep
        Keep me safe
        We need light, we need love
        lift me up in your arms
        (Hold me down) I need love, I need love, I need love
        (Keep me close) hold me, hold me
        (Safe and sound) hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
        (Lift me up) hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
        (Hold me down) hold me, hold me
        (Keep me safe) we need light, we need love
    </p>
