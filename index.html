    <h3>Performed by Rihanna</h3>
    <p>
        Lift me up <br>
        Hold me down <br>
        Keep me close <br>
        Safe and sound<br>
        Burning in a hopeless dream<br>
        Hold me when you go to sleep<br>
        Keep me in the warmth of your love<br>
        When you depart, keep me safe<br>
        Safe and sound<br>
        Lift me up<br>
        Hold me down<br>
        Keep me close<br>
        Safe and sound<br>
        Drowning in an endless sea<br>
        Take some time and stay with me<br>
        Keep me in the strength of your arms<br>
        Keep me safe<br>
        Safe and sound<br>
        Lift me up<br>
        Hold me down<br>
        Keep me safe<br>
        Safe and sound<br>
        Burning in a hopeless dream<br>
        Hold me when you go to sleep<br>
        Keep me safe<br>
        We need light, we need love<br>
        lift me up in your arms<br>
        (Hold me down) I need love, I need love, I need love<br>
        (Keep me close) hold me, hold me<br>
        (Safe and sound) hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me<br>
        (Lift me up) hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me<br>
        (Hold me down) hold me, hold me<br>
        (Keep me safe) we need light, we need love<br>
    </p>
